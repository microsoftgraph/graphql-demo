# GraphQL for Microsoft Graph (DEMO)

## Call to action
We are looking for feedback from developers interested in integrating with Microsoft Graph via GraphQL. To share your thoughts and scenarios, please leave a comment on [UserVoice](https://officespdev.uservoice.com/forums/224641-feature-requests-and-feedback/suggestions/16819672-graphql-api-for-the-microsoft-graph). 

## About
This is a *demo* that enables basic, read-only querying of the [Microsoft Graph API](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/) using [GraphQL query syntax](http://graphql.org/learn/queries/). GraphQL enables clients to request exactly the resources and properties that they need instead of making REST requests for each resource and consolidating the responses. To create a GraphQL service, this demo translates the [Microsoft Graph OData $metadata document](https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata) to a GraphQL schema and generates the necessary resolvers. Please note we are providing this demo code for evaluation as-is.

## Live demo
[Try the Microsoft Graph GraphQL Demo here](https://graphql-demo.azurewebsites.net/)

## Installation
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies (`npm install`)
3. Generate schema description and resolver code using `npm run build`
4. Navigate to the [App Registration Portal](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/), set up a [new web app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-v2-app-registration)
5. Configure App Id and redirect URIs in the AppConfiguration of build/index.html
6. Run `npm start` and go to `localhost:1337`

## Sample requests
#### Fetch recent emails

```graphql

{
  me {
    displayName
    officeLocation
    skills
    messages {
      subject
      isRead
      from {
        emailAddress {
          address
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```


#### Fetch groups and members
```graphql
{
  groups {
    displayName
    description
    members {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

#### Fetch files from OneDrive
```graphql
{
  me {
    drives {
      quota {
        used
        remaining
      }
      root {
        children {
          name
          size
          lastModifiedDateTime
          webUrl
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## How it works
* src/setup.js reads in a well-formed $metadata CSDL, parses it and builds up a GraphQL schema
* src/setup.js code generates resolvers that naively issues requests to the Graph service when the previous (parent) resolver doesn't have the data at hand

## Limitations/to-dos
* [x] Translate OData inheritance relationships
* [x] Enable passing arguments (id for indexing into collections)
* [ ] Support pagination
* [ ] Implement mutations
* [ ] Enable passing arguments for sort, filter
* [ ] Add heuristics for $expand to reduce number of service calls made
